### What is it? 
An event for open data enthusiasts and developers and others to get involved in their community through improving access to and use of open data in the province. A hackathon is a great place to build new open data driven apps, meet people and have a good time. 

You can sign up for the event here: <http://opendatask1.eventbrite.com>
