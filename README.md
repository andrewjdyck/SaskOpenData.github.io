Home page for Open Data Saskatchewan - a project started in the early 2010s to increase data transparency in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. Open Data Saskatchewan was active in the open data development community in the province, appearing at several conferences and hacker events and was influential in getting open data off the ground in the province.

The project has not been active since 2015, however, the project lead, [Andy Dyck](www.andrewdyck.com), [continues to write on the topic of economic and social trends](https://opendatask.substack.com/p/coming-soon?r=697fo&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) in the province using open data where possible.
