      <description>Letter to political parties Sent to all six registered political parties in Saskatchewan on September 20, 2020.
 Hi,
I write to you today to inquire about the PARTY NAME HERE position on a topic of importance to citizens of Saskatchewan. Information is foundational to both the full functioning of our democracy, as well as, increasingly, the successful integration of the information economy into that of our own.</description>

      <description>It was International Open Data Day on March 5, 2017. The day has breezed by me this year, as with many previous years. Let’s review where the province has been on open data over this time and where it might be going.
Recap of Open Data Saskatchewan This site has now been live for just over 5 years. There hasn’t been much change to the site over this time, but there have been some changes in the province.</description>

      <description>What is it? An event for open data enthusiasts and developers and others to get involved in their community through improving access to and use of open data in the province. A hackathon is a great place to build new open data driven apps, meet people and have a good time.
You can sign up for the event here: http://opendatask1.eventbrite.com
Where and when? The nice folks at the George Bothwell library have agreed to have us on Saturday, December 3, 2011 from 10am - 4pm.</description>

      <title>Open Data Day in Saskatchewan</title>

      <description>Starting off the Open Data Saskatchewan blog I&amp;rsquo;d like to throw an idea out there to hold an introductory open data event in Regina, SK on international open data day, which is December 3, 2011. I&amp;rsquo;ve added Regina to the list of cities hosting a &amp;lsquo;hackathon&amp;rsquo; meeting on that day, however, anyone in Saskatchewan interested in open data should consider attending if they can. I&amp;rsquo;d like to work with some others interested in attending to see what type of events we can do on this day.</description>
